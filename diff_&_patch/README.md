# Diff and Patch

## Description

The Unix tools diff and patch work in such a way that one can run a diff between file A and file B, and then use patch
 with the output of the diff and file A to produce file B.

This folder contains an implementation of both, written them to work on the shell similarly to the POSIX manual 
descriptions. 

When your diff application is run on two files, it should be possible to use either file together with the diff output 
to produce the other.
